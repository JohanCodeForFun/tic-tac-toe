###Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, designed to be played in a web browser. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move, displaying the game's outcome and allowing for a game reset to start over.

### Features
- **Dynamic Board Rendering**: The game board is dynamically generated and rendered in the browser, allowing for interactive gameplay.
- **Player Turns**: Two players can input their names and take turns playing the game, with their current turn displayed on the screen.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces a win or draw, highlighting the winning combination if applicable.
- **Game Reset**: Players can reset the game at any point to start a new game without refreshing the browser page.

### How to Play
1. Start the Game: Enter the names of the two players in the input fields provided and click the "Start" button.
2. Play: Players take turns clicking on the empty cells in the 3x3 grid to mark their symbol (X or O). The current player's turn is displayed on the screen.
3. Win or Draw: The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
4. Restart: Click the "Restart" button to clear the board and start a new game.
